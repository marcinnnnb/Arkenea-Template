# Arkenea-Template
Template has been coded, based on PSD template: https://psdrepo.com/free-psd/arkenea-template-freebie/
Thank you @Prashant Dwivedi for sharing the file! 

Extra features added to this project:
1. First email input has a validation. Providing email address, information appears, depends if it's valid or not
2. Sticky header
3. Swiper

Website is mostly responsive. Looks ok for me. For sure, could be done better. It's something wrong with footer section. For mobile is not responsive and looks
messy. I will correct it soon!
